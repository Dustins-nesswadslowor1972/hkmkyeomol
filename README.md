Whoa. Still catching my breath after walking out of The Accountant 2. Theater was buzzing, or maybe that's the hum in my ears? You know, the popcorn was stale but worth it somehow. Ben Affleck back in action, more intense, like he’s carrying every tax return issue on his beefy shoulders. I swear half the   was just him staring intently at spreadsheets like they held the secrets to life itself... which maybe they do?

I got crumbs all over my jeans. But back to the 𝘧𝘪𝘭𝘮 — there’s this scene where he’s balancing books and balancing on top of speeding cars?? Like, how does anyone even THINK of doing that? Haha like balancing my checkbook... if my checkbook was a raging bull. Theater was full of whispers and rustling — the kind that makes you forget which popcorn bucket is yours until it’s too late and you’ve invaded someone else's snack territory. Sorry, random dude.

> The   kept diving into these crazy action scenes, and just when you think he's got the villain calculated, there's another plot twist — like a surprise punch when you least expect. His eyes, man, they’re like spreadsheets with emotions... if such a thing makes any sense. Felt like Affleck could see through me, calculating my debts.

The subplot was kinda hard to follow with the vending machine being louder than the dialogue at points. But, weirdly added to the vibe, you know? I still can't shake the image of Affleck awkwardly eating a sandwich alone, almost made me wanna 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   for that scene alone - 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   with someone who gets it.

You remember when someone asked me if I'd check it out? Yeah, def something you might want to 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 later, 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 cradled up in your armchair with the cat sitting like a distracting hen on your shoulder.

And there's this part, near the end, when he looks right at the camera, and I half-expected him to chuck a calculator at my face. Or maybe that was just the dude next to me reaching for his bag, idk. Random memory gaps – not related to plot holes, just full bladder tension. Gotta pee.

```csharp
void TheaterExperience()
{
    int plotTwist = 0;
    while(backAche > comfortLevel)
    {
        if (popcorn == 'salty') popcorn++;
            else forgetScene();
    }
    // Something was here, can't remember... 
}
```
